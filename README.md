homework - ToDo: ~500 words about experience and what we learned 

Overall this tutorial was fun and informational. This first part was a basic helloworld assignment that brought back good memories of when we first learned how to code, but that being said it was also fairly straight forward in terms of coding. The interesting part however was how the JavaFX played into the code. Even though it was fairly straight forward itself in terms of incorporation of code it also cool to try out new libraries and see how they work with java. The second assignment was more advanced and provided a lot more opportunity for learning, but it also was reminiscent of web app work seen done with python. All in all the first two assignments were straight forward and informational. The third one was very easy for the both of us as it was dealing with basic CSS work, and both of us have had experience with that. Even though it was easy and straightforward, it was still a good experience to brush up on old skills and learn to incorporate them with new ones. It was because of this that the third assignment was the most fun for both of us.
